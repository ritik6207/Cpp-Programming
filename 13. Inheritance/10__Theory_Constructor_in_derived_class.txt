**  Constructor in Derived Class:- 

1. We can use Constructor in Derived Classes in C++
2. If base class Constructor does not have any arguments, there is no need of any constructor in derived class
3. But if there are one or more argument in the base class constructor, derived class need to pass argument to the base class Constructor.
4. If both base and derived Classes have constructor , base class constructor is exuecuted first.

** Constructor in Multiple inheritance:-

1. In Multiple inheritance , base Classes are constructor in the order in which they appear in the class declaration
2. In Multiple inheritance , the constructor are exuecuted in the order of inheritance 

** Special Syntax: - 

1. C++ suppots an Special Syntax for passing argument to Multiple base Classes
2. The constructor of the derived class receives all the arguments at once and then will pass the calls to the respective base Classes
3. The body is called after all the constructor are finished exuecuting.

Derived-Constructor(agr1, arg2, agr3......):Base 1 -Constructor(agr1,arg2), Base 2 -Constructor(agr3, agr4)
{
    .........
}Base 1 -Constructor(agr1,arg2)


** Special Case of Virtual Base class:-

1. The constructor for Virtual base Classes are invoked before an nonvitual base class 
2. If there are Multiple Virtual base Classes , they are invoked in order declaed.
3. Any non-Virtual base class are then before the derived class Constructor is executed
